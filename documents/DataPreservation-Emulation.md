Digital Preservation - Dioscuri (Emulation Strategy)
=================================
As discussed in earlier posts we have emulation based solutions to the longevity Issue. One of the substantial work done on this line is Dioscuri. A team lead by Jeff Rothenberg (one of the key contributor in the field of digital data preservation) is responsible for this project. They received funds from various Global projects.
Let us briefly see what this project is and how it solves the problems in Digital Data Longevity.

Dioscuri is an x86 computer hardware emulator written in Java. It is designed by the digital preservation community to ensure documents and programs from past can still be accessed in the future. It emulates various components of the hardware architecture as individual emulators and interconnecting them in order to create a full emulation process. Dioscuri team argues that their solution is durable, as it can be ported to any platform with Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and flexible, as it is completely component-based.
