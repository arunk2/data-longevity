### Audio Sampling rate: 
It is the number of samples of a sound that are taken per second to represent it digitally. 
More the samples are taken per second - accuracy will be more.

The following tables gives an idea:

| Audio quality	Sample | Rate (Hz)
| ------ | -------
| Telephone | 8000
| AM Radio | 11025
| FM Radio | 22050
| CD | 44100
| DAT(custom) | 48000

### Channel: 
An audio channel or audio track is 1 audio signal stored representing the whole or part of audio. 
Based on the no.of audio channels stored in audio file â€“ we reproduce the original sound @ receiving end. 
The following list gives an idea.


| No.of Channels | Common Name | Visibility
| ------ | ------- | ----------
| Channels 1 | mono | FC (1 speaker)
| Channels 2 | stereo | FL+FR (Typical 2 speaker)
| Channels 3 | 2.1 | FL+FR+LFE (Desktop sound system)
|...|...|...
| Channels 6 | 5.1 |	FL+FR+FC+LFE+BL+BR (home theatre)
|...|...|...
| BEYOND 11 CHANNEL | DOLBY ATMOS | (Dolby Atmos adds ceiling-mounted speakers to create special effects which emanate from above the viewer.)


### Bit rate:
It is the no.of bits transferred/processed per unit time (per second). 
In current context - It is the no.of bits required to represent 1 second of media data. 
Both MP3 and AAC audio format use lossy data compression. 


Typically the audio quality improves with increasing bit rate:

| Bit rate | Usage
| ------ | -------
| 32 kbit/s |  generally acceptable only for speech
| 96 kbit/s | generally used for speech or low-quality streaming
| 128 or 160 kbit/s |  mid-range bitrate quality
| 192 kbit/s | medium quality bitrate
| 256 kbit/s | a commonly used high-quality bitrate
| 320 Kbit/s | highest level supported by the MP3 standard
