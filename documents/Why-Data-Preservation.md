Digital data Logevity - Problem
============================

## Digital dark age:
Knowingly or unknowingly we entered a **digital dark age** now. 
Consider famous internet services shutdown like Yahoo photos, Friendster, Geocities and Google Video. 
Unless users migrated their data (downloaded their data and uploaded to an alternative service provider), their data are lost. 
Unfortunately I am 1 among the users who lost the data. I lost all my photos taken my first JOB nearly 1000+ digital photos.

Let us discuss further. 

Do you think emails will exist in 2064? 

Will Google, Facebook, Flickr, Picasa and other cloud based service providers exist for 50 years from now? 

If services providers and services cease to exist, what about the data they hold? Will they exist? 
Are there any strategies or roadmaps? There are some legal aspects related to copyrights to be considered as well.

## Real Issue:
We always have a Naive Solution of arguing What If I take regular backups of my data (in CDs/DVDs)? Wont my data survive?

**The answer is No.**

This opens the gate for an even more pressing problem of technology obsolescence. 

Will artifacts (documents, videos, audio etc.,) created now be available or even readable in 50 years from now? 

If the technology becomes obsolete or if the software or hardware are outdated.
**Example:** Foppy discs, punch cards no longer exist and files of WordStar, .cpio, .s7z, .cpt, .dd, .pit extensions formats.
All datas you stored there, may be inaccessible/unreadable or simply lost. 

Severity of this problem is open to debate and many acknowledge it to be one of the hard problems in computer science.


By now it is very clear that the entire human knowledge available only in digital forms is at huge risk. 
There are two critical reasons for this situation 
- Physical deterioration of storage media
- Technological obsolescence of hardware/software interpreting digital data.


## What should digital preservation mean?

In the definition medium from American Library Association (ALA), we have the following statement 
- "The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time."

In digital preservation paradigm â€“ one of the most difficult challenges is to maintain the interpretability of data across changing technologies. 

A sequence of bits is meaningless if it cannot be decoded and transformed into some meaningful representation. 
**Example: Documents stored as Word Star, a 1978 format, are as good as unreadable today**. There has been significant amount of research work happened over the past 2 decades to address this problem. All of the long term access strategies proposed can be broadly categorized under 
- Migration strategy
- Emulation strategy
