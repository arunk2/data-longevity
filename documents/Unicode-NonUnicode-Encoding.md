Unicode and Non-Unicode Encoding of Indic Languages
===================================================
To properly view any language encoding schemes in the browser/notepad or 
any text processing application following things are mandatory:

- Support from Operating System/Application, which understands the encoding scheme
- Font files for the OS/Application of the choice

Before Unicode standardization, many of the non-English languages created their own scheme for encoding and used them. 

With the introduction of Unicode all this changed. 
Almost all modern operating systems and browsers support Unicode and many of them ship with font packs for all the major international languages. 
Tamil and other major Indian languages Unicode is supported in almost all the OS and browsers available.
