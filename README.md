# Motivation:
 - 'Digital information lasts forever or five years, whichever comes first'
 - 'Old bit streams never die -they just become unreadable'
      -Jeff Rothenberg, scientist and specialist in digital longevity
      
# Problem Statement – Data Longevity:
##Why Data Longevity?
 - Availability of data (after 10, 50, 100, 1000 years)
 - Big data –3Vs (Variety, Volume, Velocity)
 - Availability of the data is jeopardized
 - Will standardization of data formats?
 - Lot of proprietary formats -huge market share
      
# Solution:
 - Migrating the application(or a part of app used for viewing) to a standard format and retaining it along with original data for preservation.
 - At any point in future (after 1 day, 1 year, 10 or 100 years), we ensure the guaranteed rendering of original data with the corresponding application.
 - We have a Basic machine emulator and simple OS, which can run any 'Eternal Binary' mentioned above. We will emulate the original environment for the reader application at the time of storage and open the data in it. Hence, we get the original rendering effect of the data being preserved.
